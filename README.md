## Hi I'm William Amorim ðŸ‘‹

Passionate about programming and technology. Always looking to learn more to do my best and bring more solutions to problems in the world.

Currently I've been studying ways to write readable and maintainable code quickly and easily, through software architectures, principles and good programming practices.

I love studying, learning and sharing new things.
